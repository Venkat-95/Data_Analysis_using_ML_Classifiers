The following data from the Lexmed project are given:

app.data: File with 9764 training data. One case per patient (line).
           The label (appendicitis yes / no) in the last column.

app_unlabeled.test: file with 4882 test data. Like app.data, but without a label.

app.names: Contains the variable names and types (C4.5 input file)

Task:

Train one classifier each with logistic regression and with
an SVM and determine the optimum with cross-validation
Parameter. Then apply the two optimized classifiers to the
Test data in app_unlabeled.test and create two files
app_logreg.test and app_svm.test, which in addition to the symptoms in the end
each line the labels generated by your two programs
contain.

Now delete all lines with the label '0' from app.data and turn
Do a one-class SVM on the rest. You can find one-class SVMs in the
LibSVM as well as in Scikit-Learn. Again, apply cross validation
on to finding the optimal meta parameter. Then test yours
Classifier on the data in app_unlabeled.test and generate like
above a result file named app_ocl.test.
